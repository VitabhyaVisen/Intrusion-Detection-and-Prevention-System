# Intrusion-Detection-and-Prevention-System
Python-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) that monitors network traffic in real time, detects suspicious activities (like ICMP/HTTP anomalies), logs events, and generates alerts. It provides a lightweight yet effective solution to strengthen network security.

# Features
Real-time packet capture and analysis
Custom detection rules for ICMP, HTTP, and other protocols
Logging of alerts and suspicious activity
Extensible rule set for new attack patterns
Option to block/deny malicious traffic

# Usage
Alerts will be logged in the logs/ directory.
Add or modify rules in the rules/ folder to customize detection.
Use the scripts/ folder for testing traffic (e.g., ICMP pings, HTTP requests).

# Future Improvements
Add web dashboard for monitoring alerts
Implement machine learning–based anomaly detection
Support for more advanced protocols
